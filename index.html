The University of Florida's Recent Camupus Sex Crimes
   </h1>
   <div id="map2"></div>
   <p>
    The University of Florida Police Department keeps data on all crimes committed on its campuses. However, they recently removed the geocoded map to show where these crimes were happening on campus. Fortunately, thanks to Student journalists at the College of Journalism, this crime mapping data was reobtained and published for public use. This map was created using the data for some of the most recent sex crimes committed on campus.
