My name is Richard Bennett, I am an investigative reporter and a student at the University of Florida, this is a map to show all of the different little college campuses I went to as a transfer student at the University of Florida. Most of the very small colleges were in very small towns but I was fortunate enough that I was able to attend the ones local to me because my family didnt have money at the time to help me pay for gas to commute all the way to gainesville every day for class.

The University of Florida's Recent Camupus Sex Crimes
   </h1>
   <div id="map2"></div>
   <p>
    The University of Florida Police Department keeps data on all crimes committed on its campuses. However, they recently removed the geocoded map to show where these crimes were happening on campus. Fortunately, thanks to Student journalists at the College of Journalism, this crime mapping data was reobtained and published for public use. This map was created using the data for some of the most recent sex crimes committed on campus.
