My name is Richard Bennett, I am a reporter and this is a map to show all of the different little college campuses I went to as a transfer student at the University of Florida. Most of the very small colleges were in very small towns but I was fortunate enough that I was able to attend the ones local to me because my family didnt have money at the time to help me pay for gas to commute all the way to gainesville every day for class.
